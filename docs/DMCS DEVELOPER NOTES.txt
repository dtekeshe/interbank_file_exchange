
Hi David,

1.	CCR001 and CCR005 do not show any interchange for the R165 Purchase order between SBSA to Capitec.
2.	The Settlement file and SV01 show R1.65 values, which should read R165.

When you think this is fixed we can re-run with the same transaction and ‘desk-check’ the settlement record

Should read
